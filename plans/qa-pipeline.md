# Birth-registrations QA pipeline plan

Open items from wiring up the real dbt-core/Soda Core/datacontract-cli/
Evidently tools (`real_tools/*.py`) against this pipeline. Everything here
is either a genuine bug found by actually running the real tools, or a
documented equivalent-vs-real-tool disagreement worth a second look.
Scoped to this repo's `contract/`/`dbt_project/`/`engines/`/`real_tools/`
work specifically — wider-project items live in `plans/wider.md`.

Status values: `open` / `workaround shipped` / `done`. Priority is
relative, not a schedule — this is weeks of work, not months.

## Found running the real tools

1. **[workaround shipped, high]** dbt-duckdb reliability bug. dbt-core's
   own reported `failures` count was reproducibly wrong (0 instead of the
   true row count) on some runs for a percentage-based `fail_calc`, while
   the identical compiled SQL run directly via DuckDB's Python API always
   gave the right answer. Root cause not found despite extensive isolation
   (removed all arithmetic, disabled partial parsing, forced
   `--store-failures`, substituted SUM for COUNT — see
   `dbt_project/models/staging/schema.yml`'s comments for the full trail).
   Current fix: absolute row-count thresholds instead of a computed
   percentage, plus independent re-verification in
   `real_tools/run_dbt_real.py`. **Follow-up:** build a minimal standalone
   repro (no dbt project, just the SQL pattern) and file it upstream
   against `duckdb-labs/dbt-duckdb`; `plans/wider.md` #3/#4 (CI, Postgres)
   might also shed light on this without extra effort.

2. **[open, medium]** `soda-core-duckdb`'s `duckdb<1.1.0` pin isn't a
   compatibility ceiling — it pins to a DuckDB version with a published
   CVE (GHSA-w2gf-jxc9-pf2q), patched in 1.1.0. Confirmed via upstream
   issue `sodadata/soda-core#2295`. Currently ignored (we run on 1.5.5,
   verified working end to end — see `requirements-real.txt`'s comments).
   **Follow-up:** there's a newer `soda-duckdb` V4 package
   (`sodadata/soda-core/soda-duckdb`) that's actively maintained — worth
   checking whether it's the intended replacement and whether
   `run_soda_real.py`'s `Scan` API still exists there before migrating.

3. **[open, low]** Soda's `[recent]` scoped check (`filter ... where:
   extract_timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - 1`) never gets meaningfully
   exercised against real Soda Core — it uses the actual wall-clock date,
   and this fixture's synthetic runs are all in the past by the time
   anyone actually runs it, so the scope always resolves to 0 rows.
   Documented as a real, honest finding (README's known-disagreements
   section), not fixed. **Follow-up:** regenerate the synthetic runs on a
   rolling window near "today" instead of a fixed Sept 2026 range, so the
   scoped check has real data to filter — would also un-stale the fixture
   generally.

4. **[open, low]** Evidently's PSI and the equivalent engine's PSI
   genuinely differ (0.144 vs 0.179 on the red run) because Evidently bins
   by every distinct observed value while `drift_engine.py` collapses
   everything outside {M,F,X} into one `_other` bucket. Both valid;
   documented, not reconciled. **Follow-up:** decide whether to make the
   equivalent's PSI bin per-distinct-value too (closer fidelity to
   Evidently, more equivalent-engine complexity) or leave it as a
   deliberate simplification — either is defensible, just needs a call.

5. **[open, low]** `engines/contract_engine.py`'s `type: sql` rule handling
   (added when the contract was rewritten to real ODCS vocabulary) uses a
   temp-view + string-replace to scope each SQL rule to one run's rows.
   Works, but is fragile — equivalent-only tech debt, not a real-tool
   issue.

6. **[open, low]** The two-step `pip install` requirement
   (`requirements-real.txt` then separately `pip install
   'datacontract-cli[duckdb]'`) is brittle — a single combined install is
   a hard resolver failure today. Worth a periodic recheck as
   `dbt-duckdb`/`soda-core-duckdb`/`datacontract-cli` release new
   versions; this could resolve cleanly on its own, or break differently.

9. **[done, medium]** Two of the three Child Protection cross-table
   business rules used to fail on *every* run, dirty or clean, at a stable
   rate: placement/carer approval compliance (37/242 placements, ~15%) and
   closed-case investigation hygiene (16/181 investigations, ~9%).
   Confirmed for real and triangulated across all three tools —
   `datacontract test`, `dbt test`, and `soda scan` all independently
   reported the same 37 and 16 on the same data. Not a bug in the rules:
   `synthetic-data-generator/child_protection.py` genuinely didn't enforce
   either invariant (`carer_for_placement` was drawn from the full carer
   pool regardless of `approval_status`; `case_status` and investigation
   `end_date` were generated independently).
   **Fixed** (Keith's call: fix the generator, strict 0% on clean runs,
   case closure derives from investigation state): `child_protection.py`
   now only ever assigns an Approved carer to a placement, and only ever
   marks a case Closed once none of that client's own investigations are
   still open (case_status is drawn as a candidate early, same as before,
   then overridden to "Open" for any client with a still-open
   investigation — keeps every other column's RNG stream byte-identical to
   pre-fix output; row counts are unchanged). Both business rules now pass
   0/0 on every clean run. `generator/dirty.py` gained two new presets
   (`apply_cp_placements_presets`, `apply_cp_investigations_presets`,
   mirrored into `synthetic-data-generator/dirty.py` to keep the two
   copies in sync) so amber/red runs still demonstrate a real,
   controlled violation — confirmed for real and triangulated again across
   all three tools: 0 clean / 3 amber / 17 red (placement/carer) and
   0 clean / 1-3 amber / 6 red (closed-case hygiene). `data/cp_raw/` was
   regenerated; `plans/wider.md` #2's row-count calibration in the
   contract was rechecked and didn't need changes (row counts are
   unaffected by the fix, only which values land in `carer_id`/
   `case_status`/`end_date`).

10. **[done, medium]** Dashboard check display was hard for a human reader
    to make sense of, flagged against a concrete example
    (`notification_id`): its drawer headlined `dbt:not_null` (flat 0,
    "No material change") while the tile itself was Red from a different
    check several cards down, because `checks[0]` — which drives the
    headline chart — was ordered by a hand-curated `CHECK_PRIORITY` dict
    that only had entries for a couple of columns. The 4 raw tool check
    names (`dbt:unique`, `datacontract:duplicate_count`, ...) also gave no
    hint that two of them were the same real-world question asked by two
    tools.
    **Fixed** in `pipeline/dashboard_check_labels.py` (shared by both
    dashboard builders): `rank_for_headline()` sorts each column's checks
    by their own current-run status (worst first, using the exact rule
    `checkStatus()` renders with) instead of a lookup table that can go
    stale; `display_name()` prefixes a short plain-language label (Null
    rate, Duplicate rate, Invalid values, Referential integrity,
    Distribution drift, Row count) sourced from an explicit `label` field
    every `real_tools/*.py` script and `engines/*.py` equivalent now
    writes onto each check result at construction time — not guessed
    later from the check name string, after Keith pushed back on an
    earlier version that did exactly that. The dashboard's existing but
    always-blank `dimension` field is now populated the same way and
    shown as a badge on each check card.
    Three real, pre-existing bugs surfaced along the way, each found by
    actually looking rather than assumed:
    - `engines/dbt_test_engine.py` (birth-registrations' equivalent dbt
      engine) reads `dbt_project/models/staging/schema.yml` directly with
      no `--select` scoping — the same class of regression as
      `run_dbt_real.py`'s missing `--select` (see performance.md #2), just
      in the hand-rolled interpreter. It was iterating all 7 models in the
      shared schema.yml and crashing on the first Child Protection column
      it hit. This means `pipeline/orchestrate.py` — which produces
      `reports/results.json`, the file the *live* Birth Registrations
      dashboard tile actually reads — had been silently broken since
      Phase 2, showing stale pre-Phase-2 data instead of erroring
      visibly, until this was found by re-running it for the first time
      since.
    - `soda_engine.py`'s dimension logic (`"validity" if "invalid" in
      check_name else "completeness"`) missed the one custom-named check
      in the dataset: "sex validity, last 24h only" contains "validity",
      not "invalid", so it was silently mislabeled completeness. Invisible
      until dimension was actually rendered.
    - datacontract-cli's 7 FK checks and 3 Child Protection business rules
      are both written as table-level `type: sql` rules (ODCS has no
      per-property home for a rule that joins to another table), so both
      arrived with `column_name="(table)"` and both landed in the
      dashboard's `(table-level checks)` pseudo-column — inconsistent with
      dbt's `relationships` tests and Soda's `values in ... must exist
      in ...` checks for the exact same FKs, which the dashboard already
      attributes to the FK column itself. Fixed in
      `run_datacontract_real_cp.py` by parsing the FK column straight out
      of each rule's own description (all 7 follow the same "Every
      `<table>`'s `<column>` must reference an existing `<table>` row."
      shape) — the 3 business rules' differently-shaped descriptions are
      untouched.
    Verified with Playwright throughout, including a full re-check of
    `notification_id` and `cp_client_id`'s drawers and the executive/
    agency views; no regressions on either real dataset.

## Held over from the original (equivalent-only) build

Lower priority — these were already documented as deliberate, honest
simplifications before any real tool ran, and nothing since has changed
that assessment. Listed here so they don't get lost, not because they're
urgent.

7. **[open, low]** ODCS severity is single-tier (pass/fail or pass/warn,
   never a three-way band). `contract_engine.py` encodes that into the
   dashboard's two-threshold shape as warn==fail (error severity) or an
   unreachable fail ceiling (warning/info severity). Real, not a bug —
   revisit only if the dashboard's shape itself changes.

8. **[open, low]** Soda's `row_count` check is a genuine two-sided range
   (too few *or* too many rows); `soda_engine.py`'s `_numeric_threshold()`
   reduces it to the upper bound only for display — the one place a piece
   of real information (the lower bound) is dropped for a single scalar.
   Would need a dashboard/schema change (a second threshold field) to fix
   properly, not just an engine change.
