# Road testing

Things noticed while actually USING the dashboard and the `mothman`
CLI/TUI, as opposed to things found by designing, reviewing code or
reading a requirement. Keith's own ask, 2026-09-24: a place for what
turns up when you sit down and drive the thing like a user would.

Deliberately a different kind of file from its neighbours. `plans/
dashboard.md` holds features and design work for the dashboard;
`plans/qa-pipeline.md` holds real bugs found running the real tools.
This one holds **observations from use** - something that is confusing,
unlabelled, misleading, slow to find, or simply not what a reader would
assume - which may turn out to be a bug, a feature, a wording fix or
nothing at all once it is looked at properly.

An entry here is a SIGHTING, not a diagnosis. Write down what was
actually seen and what it made you think, before working out what is
really going on - the value of the record is that it captures the
reader's assumption at the moment it was formed, which is exactly what
is lost by the time someone has read the code.

Same conventions as every other numbered-item plans file: a closed
status (`todo` / `investigate` / `in-progress` / `parked` / `done` /
`superseded`), one or more component tags, and a date. Per `CLAUDE.md`,
anything here that turns into real build work becomes a requirement in
`requirements.yaml`, and the entry comes out when it lands.

1. **[investigate, 2026-09-24]** **[Dashboard UI]** **A trend is drawn
   in two different places, measuring two different things, and neither
   says which.** Keith's own sighting, road-testing the dashboard: it is
   not clear whether a trend line is row counts, failure counts,
   supplies or something else. It should say what it plots rather than
   just saying "Trend".

   **What the two actually plot**, read out of
   `dashboard/qa-reporting-dashboard.template.html` rather than assumed,
   because they are genuinely different quantities:

   - **The dataset table's `Trend` column** (`aggregateSparkline()` /
     `aggregateFailureSeries()`) plots, per run date, the **share of
     that scope's applicable checks that were not green** - a RATE
     between 0 and 1, deliberately not a raw count, because a check
     introduced or retired mid-history moves the denominator. The
     endpoint dot is coloured by the worst status that run. Nothing
     on screen says any of this. The column header is the bare word
     "Trend", there is no axis, no tooltip, no legend and no units; the
     only text anywhere is the SVG's `aria-label`, "aggregate
     failing-check trend sparkline", which a sighted reader never sees.
   - **The per-check trend chart in the drawer** (`trendChart()`) plots
     that ONE check's own metric over its run history, with warn and
     fail threshold lines. Better off, since the endpoint value is
     printed through `fmtMetric(value, unit)` and the unit carries the
     meaning - but the y-axis itself has no title, and the "View as
     table" header is the bare word "Value", so a check measuring a row
     count, a failing-row count and a percentage all render under
     identical labelling.

   **Why this is worth more than a label tweak.** The two are adjacent
   in the same UI and one is a RATE while the other is a RAW METRIC, so
   a reader who works out what one means will carry that reading to the
   other and be wrong. A falling line means "fewer checks failing" in
   the column and "this metric went down" in the drawer, which for some
   checks is bad news.

   **Also worth checking while in here**, both unverified: whether the
   `Rows, latest run` column and the trend column can be read as the
   same series when they are not, and whether the aggregate rate is
   legible at all as a sparkline with no scale - a line pinned near the
   bottom by the 0.05 floor looks like a low flat value rather than an
   all-green history.

   **Not yet scoped, and it needs Keith before it is.** The real fork is
   whether these get named in place (a header that says what is
   measured, an axis title, a tooltip) or whether the aggregate one
   needs a different treatment entirely at 30 datasets, where a column
   of unlabelled sparklines is thirty invitations to the same wrong
   reading.
